1 - Create a Dockerfile at the root of todo-lis-app project
with the following commands:

 FROM node:12-alpine
 WORKDIR /app
 COPY . .
 RUN yarn install --production
 CMD ["node", "src/index.js"]


2 - In the root of the project execute the following 
command to build the container image -> 
        
        docker build -t getting-started .

This command used the Dockerfile to build a new container image. 

After the image was downloaded, we copied in our application and used yarn to install our applicationâ€™s dependencies. 

The CMD directive specifies the default command to run when starting a container from this image.

Finally, the -t flag tags our image. Think of this simply as a human-readable 
name for the final image. Since we named the image getting-started, 
we can refer to that image when we run a container.

The . at the end of the docker build command tells that Docker 
should look for the Dockerfile in the current directory.
