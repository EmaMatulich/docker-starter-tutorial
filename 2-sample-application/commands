1 - Create a Dockerfile at the root of todo-lis-app project
with the following commands:

 FROM node:12-alpine
 WORKDIR /app
 COPY . .
 RUN yarn install --production
 CMD ["node", "src/index.js"]


2 - In the root of the project execute the following 
command to build the container image -> 
        
        docker build -t getting-started .

This command used the Dockerfile to build a new container image. 

After the image was downloaded, we copied in our application and used yarn to install our application’s dependencies. 

The CMD directive specifies the default command to run when starting a container from this image.

Finally, the -t flag tags our image. Think of this simply as a human-readable 
name for the final image. Since we named the image getting-started, 
we can refer to that image when we run a container.

The . at the end of the docker build command tells that Docker 
should look for the Dockerfile in the current directory.

3 - Start your container using the docker run command and specify the name of the image we just created:

         docker run -dp 3000:3000 getting-started
-d -> running the new container in “detached” mode (in the background) 
-p -> creating a mapping between the host’s port 3000 to the container’s port 3000.
