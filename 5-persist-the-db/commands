1 - Create a volume by using the docker volume create command:

         docker volume create todo-db

2 - Start the todo app container, but add the -v flag to specify a volume mount. 
We will use the named volume and mount it to /etc/todos, which will capture 
all files created at the path.

         docker run -dp 3000:3000 -v todo-db:/etc/todos getting-started

3 - If we want to inspect the volume we can execute:

        docker volume inspect todo-db
