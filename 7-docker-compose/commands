1- Start up the application stack using the docker-compose up command. Weâ€™ll add the -d flag to run everything in the background.

     docker-compose up -d

2 - To tear it all down, simply run docker-compose down. The containers will stop and the network will be removed.   

3 - By default, named volumes in your compose file are NOT removed when running docker-compose down. 
If you want to remove the volumes, you will need to add the --volumes flag.
